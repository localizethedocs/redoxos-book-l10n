"Some programs are interpreted by a runtime for the program's language, such "
"as a script running in the GNU Bash shell or a Python program. Others are "

"The porting of programs on Redox is done case-by-case, if a program just "
"need small patches, the programmer can modify the Rust crate source code or "
"add `.patch` files on the recipe folder, but if big or dirty patches are "
"needed, Redox create a fork of it on GitLab and rebase for a while in the "
"`redox` branch of the fork (some Redox forks use branches for different "
"versions)."

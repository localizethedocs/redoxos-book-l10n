"Redox functions and modules should use `rustdoc` annotations where possible, "
"as they can be used to generate online API documentation - this ensures "
"uniform documentation between those two halves. In particular, this is more "
"strictly required for public APIs; internal functions can generally eschew "
"them (though having explanations for any code can still help newcomers to "
"understand the codebase). When in doubt, making code more literate is "
"better, so long as it doesn't negatively affect the functionality. Run "
"`rustdoc` against any added documentation of this type before submitting "
"them to check for correctness, errors, or odd formatting."

"Documentation for the Redox Book generally should not include API "
"documentation directly, but rather cover higher-level overviews of the "
"entire codebase, project, and community. It is better to have information in "
"the Book than not to have it, so long as it is accurate, relevant, and well-"
"written. When writing documentation for the Book, be sure to run `mdbook` "
"against any changes to test the results before submitting them."

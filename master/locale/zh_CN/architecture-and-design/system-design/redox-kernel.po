"System calls are generally simple, and have a similar ABI compared to "
"regular function calls. On x86-64, it simply uses the `syscall` instruction, "
"causing a mode switch from user-mode (ring 3) to kernel-mode (ring 0), and "
"when the system call handler is finished, its mode switches back, as if the "
"`syscall` instruction was a regular `call` instruction, using `sysretq`."

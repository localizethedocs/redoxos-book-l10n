"Since version 0.8.0, Redox can now be installed on certain hard drives and "
"internal SSDs, including some vintage systems. USB devices are not yet "
"supported during run-time, although they can be used for installation and "
"_livedisk_ boot. Check the release notes for additional details on supported "
"hardware. Systems with unsupported devices can still use the _livedisk_ "
"method described below. Ensure you backup your data before trying Redox on "
"your hardware."

"Hardware support is limited at the moment, so your milage may vary. Only USB "

"Realtek and Intel ethernet controllers are currently supported."

"The current ISO image uses a bootloader to load the filesystem into memory "

"without installing. Although its use of memory is inefficient, it is fully "
"functional and does not require changes to your device. The ISO image is a "

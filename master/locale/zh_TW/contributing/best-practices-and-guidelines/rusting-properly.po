msgstr ""

#: src/rusting-properly.md:5
msgid "Use `std::mem::replace` and `std::mem::swap` when you can."
msgstr ""

#: src/rusting-properly.md:6
msgid "Use `.into()` and `.to_owned()` over `.to_string()`."
msgstr ""

#: src/rusting-properly.md:7
msgid ""
"Prefer passing references to the data over owned data. (Don't take `String`, "
"take `&str`. Don't take `Vec<T>` take `&[T]`)."
msgstr ""

#: src/rusting-properly.md:8
msgid "Use generics, traits, and other abstractions Rust provides."
msgstr ""

#: src/rusting-properly.md:9
msgid ""
"Avoid using lossy conversions (for example: don't do `my_u32 as u16 == "
"my_u16`, prefer `my_u32 == my_u16 as u32`)."
msgstr ""

#: src/rusting-properly.md:10
msgid "Prefer in place (`box` keyword) when doing heap allocations."
msgstr ""

#: src/rusting-properly.md:11
msgid ""
"Prefer platform independently sized integer over pointer sized integer "
"(`u32` over `usize`, for example)."
msgstr ""

#: src/rusting-properly.md:12
msgid ""
"Follow the usual idioms of programming, such as \"composition over "
"inheritance\", \"let your program be divided in smaller pieces\", and "
"\"resource acquisition is initialization\"."

#: src/rusting-properly.md:13
msgid ""
"When `unsafe` is unnecessary, don't use it. 10 lines longer safe code is "
"better than more compact unsafe code!"
msgstr ""

#: src/rusting-properly.md:14
msgid ""
"Be sure to mark parts that need work with `TODO`, `FIXME`, `BUG`, "
"`UNOPTIMIZED`, `REWRITEME`, `DOCME`, and `PRETTYFYME`."

#: src/rusting-properly.md:15
msgid ""
"Use the compiler hint attributes, such as `#[inline]`, `#[cold]`, etc. when "
"it makes sense to do so."

#: src/rusting-properly.md:16
msgid ""
"Try to banish `unwrap()` and `expect()` from your code in order to manage "
"errors properly. Panicking must indicate a bug in the program (not an error "
"you didn't want to manage). If you cannot recover from an error, print a "
"nice error to stderr and exit. Check Rust's book about [Error Handling]"
"(https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/error-handling.html)."

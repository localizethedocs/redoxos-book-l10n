"Redox OS is a general-purpose operating system written in [Rust](https://www."

"microkernel-based operating system, that is secure, reliable and free."

#: src/introduction.md:38
msgid ""
"Redox OS was created in 2015 before the first stable version (1.0) of the "
"Rust compiler and was one of the first operating systems written in Rust. It "
"started as an unikernel (without a hypervisor) and gathered the "
"contributions of many Rust developers."
msgstr ""

#: src/introduction.md:41
msgid ""
"As the project progressed, Jeremy Soller decided that the OS should be "
"focused on stability and security. To achieve that, Redox was redesigned to "
"adopt a microkernel architecture and a unified system API for resources."
msgstr ""

#: src/introduction.md:44
msgid ""
"Minix and Plan 9 were the main inspirations for the system design in the "
"beginning."

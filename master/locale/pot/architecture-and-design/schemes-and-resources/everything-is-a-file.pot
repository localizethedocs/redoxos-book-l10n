"Unix has a concept of using file paths to represent \"special files\" that "
"have some meaning beyond a regular file. For example, a [device file]"
"(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_file) is a reference to a device "
"resource that looks like a file path."

"With the \"Everything is a file\" concept provided by Unix-like systems, all "
"sorts of devices, processes, and kernel parameters can be accessed as files "
"in a regular filesystem. If you are on a Linux computer, you should try to "
"`cd` to `/proc`, and see what's going on there."

"Redox extends this concept to a much more powerful one. Since each \"scheme "
"provider\" is free to interpret the path in its own way, new schemes can be "
"created as needed for each type of resource. This way USB devices don't end "
"up in a \"filesystem\", but a protocol-based scheme like `EHCI`. It is not "
"necessary for the file system software to understand the meaning of a "
"particular path, or to give a special file some special properties that then "
"become a fixed file system convention."

"Redox schemes are flexible enough to be used in many circumstances, with "
"each scheme provider having full flexibility to define its own path "
"conventions and meanings, and only the programs that wish to take advantage "
"of those meanings need to understand them."

"Redox does not go as far as [Plan 9](http://doc.cat-v.org/plan_9/4th_edition/"
"papers/net/), in that there are not separate paths for data and control of "
"resources. In this case, Redox is more like Unix, where resources can "
"potentially have a control interface."

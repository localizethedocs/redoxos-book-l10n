"A system component (userspace daemon) uses the Scheme API (from the `redox-"
"scheme` library) to implement the system service. The Scheme API also is "
"doing system calls like `open`, `read` and `write`, but the message format "
"for reading and writing is a special format. The latest version of the "
"Scheme API reads SQE messages and writes CQE messages. SQE is basically the "
"parameters to the system call that the caller originally did, packaged into "
"a message. CQE is the response that the daemon sends back."

"The Redox kernel is a microkernel. Microkernels stand out in their design by "
"providing minimal abstractions in kernel-space. Microkernels focus on user-"
"space, unlike Monolithic kernels which focus on kernel-space."
msgstr ""

#: src/microkernels.md:5
msgid ""
"The basic philosophy of microkernels is that any component which _can_ run "
"in user-space _should_ run in user-space. Kernel-space should only be "
"utilized for the most essential components (e.g., system calls, process "
"separation, resource management, IPC, thread management, etc)."
msgstr ""

#: src/microkernels.md:7
msgid ""
"The kernel's main task is to act as a medium for communication and "
"segregation of processes. The kernel should provide minimal abstraction over "
"the hardware (that is, drivers, which can and should run in user-space)."
msgstr ""

#: src/microkernels.md:9
msgid ""
"Microkernels are more secure and less prone to crashes and driver bugs than "
"monolithic kernels. This is because most kernel components are moved to user-"
"space and use different memory address spaces, and thus can't do damage to "
"the system. Furthermore, microkernels are extremely maintainable, due to "
"their small code size the number of bugs in the kernel is reduced a lot."

"When compared to microkernels, Monolithic kernels tend to be prone to "
"crashes and driver bugs. A buggy driver in a Monolithic kernel can crash the "
"whole system because the driver code is running on the same memory address "
"space of the kernel, thus the kernel process can't continue to run (to avoid "
"memory corruption) and crash (kernel panic). Or the bugs in a driver can "
"spread to other drivers without causing crashes, which is hard to ensure "
"stability and a headache to investigate the root of the problems."

"While in a microkernel the drivers run in different memory address spaces "
"(separation of concerns) which allows the system to handle any crash safely "

"Monolithic kernels are, well, monolithic. They do not allow fine-grained "

"The \"component panics\" (where \"component\" is the name of the system "

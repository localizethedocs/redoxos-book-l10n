"The Redox userspace API is Unix-like. For example, we have the `open`, "
"`pipe`, `pipe2`, `lseek`, `read`, `write`, `brk`, `execv` POSIX functions, "
"and so on. Currently, we implement userspace analogues of most Unix-like "
"system calls (on monolithic kernels). The kernel syscall interface itself is "
"unstable and may not be similar at all, but is closely related to the higher-"
"level POSIX APIs built on top of them, at the moment."

"However, Redox does not necessarily implement them as system calls directly. "
"Much of the machinery for these functions (typically the [man(2)](https://en."
"wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_page#Manual_sections) functions) is provided in "
"userspace through an interface library, `relibc`."

"In a model largely inspired by Plan 9, in Redox, [resources](./resources.md) "
"can be socket-like or file-like, providing a more unified system API. "
"Resources are named using paths, similar to what you would find in Linux or "
"another Unix system. But when referring to a resource that is being managed "
"by a particular resource manager, you can address it using a scheme-rooted "
"path. We will explain this later, in the [Schemes and Resources](./schemes-"
"resources.md) page."

"In contrast to Linux or BSD, Redox has around 50,000 lines of kernel code, a "

"Having vastly smaller amount of code in the kernel makes it easier to find "
"and fix bugs/security issues in an efficient way. Andrew Tanenbaum (author "
"of MINIX) stated that for every 1,000 lines of properly written C code, "
"there is a bug. This means that for a monolithic kernel with nearly "
"25,000,000 lines of C code, there could be nearly 25,000 bugs. A microkernel "
"with only 50,000 lines of C code would mean that around 50 bugs exist "
"(Tanenbaum Law)."

"Literate programs are written in such a way that humans can read them from "
"front to back, and understand the entire purpose and operation of the "
"program without preexisting knowledge about the programming language used, "
"the architecture of the program's components, or the intended use of the "
"program. As such, literate programs tend to have lots of clear and well-"
"written comments. In extreme cases of literate programming, the lines of "
"\"code\" intended for humans far outnumbers the lines of code that actually "

"Tools can be used to generate documentation for human use only based on the "
"original source code of a program. The `rustdoc` tool is a good example of "
"such a tool. In particular, `rustdoc` uses comments with three slashes `///"
"`, with special sections like `# Examples` and code blocks bounded by three "
"backticks. The code blocks can be used to writeout examples or unit tests "
"inside of comments. You can read more about `rustdoc` on the [Rust "
"documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch14-02-publishing-to-crates-"

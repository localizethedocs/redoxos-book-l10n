"Redox package management is similar to that of the major Linux "
"distributions, except that many of Redox's (Rust-written) packages use "
"static linking by default, rather than dynamic linking."

msgid ""
"Static linking can improve system security by running each program's library "
"code in isolated memory locations. This is true even when identical versions "
"of a vulnerable library are being used by multiple programs at once."
msgstr ""

#: src/package-management.md:11
msgid ""
"To steal sensitive data from statically linked programs, an attacker would "
"need to inject code directly into each program's memory address space, "

"of the attack."

#: src/package-management.md:15
msgid ""
"When a program is built with static linking, its library references are "
"resolved before execution. Thus, there's no need for processing on the "
"dynamic linker."

msgstr ""

#: src/package-management.md:21
msgid ""
"When a dynamically linked program depends on multiple versions of the same "
"library, naming conflicts can arise from the identical object or symbol "
"names within those versions. This issue can necessitate isolating the "
"library files, often by giving them unique names or placing them in separate "
"`/lib` directories, to ensure the proper version is used in each case."

"With _static linking_, however, there's no need for run-time dependency "

#: src/package-management.md:33
msgid ""
"Short for \"package archive\", `pkgar` is a file format, library, and "

msgstr ""

#: src/package-management.md:43
msgid "Atomic - Updates are done atomically if possible"
msgstr ""

#: src/package-management.md:44
msgid ""
"Economical - Transfer of data must only occur when hashes change, allowing "
"for network and data usage to be minimized"
msgstr ""

#: src/package-management.md:46
msgid ""
"Fast - Encryption and hashing algorithms are chosen for performance, and "
"packages can potentially be extracted in parallel"
msgstr ""

#: src/package-management.md:48
msgid ""
"Minimal - Unlike other formats such as `tar`, the metadata included in a "
"`pkgar` file is only what is required to extract the package"
msgstr ""

#: src/package-management.md:50
msgid ""
"Relocatable - Packages can be installed to any directory, by any user, "
"provided the user can verify the package signature and has access to that "
"directory."
msgstr ""

#: src/package-management.md:53
msgid ""
"Secure - Packages are always cryptographically secure, and verification of "
"all contents must occur before installation of a package completes."
msgstr ""

#: src/package-management.md:56
msgid ""
"To demonstrate how the format's design achieves these goals, let's look at "
"some examples."
msgstr ""

#: src/package-management.md:59
msgid "Example 1: Newly installed package"
msgstr ""

#: src/package-management.md:61
msgid ""
"In this example, a package is installed that has never been installed on the "
"system, from a remote repository. We assume that the repository's public key "
"is already installed on disk, and that the URL to the package's `pkgar` is "
"known."
msgstr ""

#: src/package-management.md:65
msgid ""
"First, a small, fixed-size header portion of the `pkgar` is downloaded. This "
"is currently 136 bytes in size. It contains a NaCL signature, NaCL public "
"key, BLAKE3 hash of the entry metadata, and 64-bit count of entry metadata "
"structs."
msgstr ""

#: src/package-management.md:69
msgid ""
"Before this header can be used, it is verified. The public key must match "
"the one installed on disk. The signature of the struct must verify against "
"the public key. If this is true, the hash and entry count are considered "
"valid."
msgstr ""

#: src/package-management.md:73
msgid ""
"The entry metadata can now be downloaded to a temporary file. During the "
"download, the BLAKE3 hash is calculated. If this hash matches the hash in "
"the header, the metadata is considered valid and is moved atomically to the "
"correct location for future use. Both the header and metadata are stored in "
"this file."
msgstr ""

#: src/package-management.md:78
msgid ""
"Each entry metadata struct contains a BLAKE3 hash of the entry data, a 64-"
"bit offset of the file data in the data portion of the `pkgar`, a 64-bit "
"size of the file data, a 32-bit mode identifying Unix permissions, and up to "
"a 256-byte relative path for the file."
msgstr ""

#: src/package-management.md:83
msgid ""
"For each entry, before downloading the file data, the path can be validated "
"for install permissions. The file data is downloaded to a temporary file, "
"with no read, write, or execute permissions. While the download is "
"happening, the BLAKE3 hash is calculated. If this hash matches, the file "
"data is considered valid."
msgstr ""

#: src/package-management.md:88
msgid ""
"After downloading all entries, the temporary files have their permissions "
"set as indicated by the mode in the metadata. They are then moved atomically "

"First, the header is downloaded. The header is verified as before. Since a "

msgstr ""

#: src/package-management.md:130
msgid ""
"As the examples show, the design of `pkgar` is meant to provide the best "

"As any microkernel-based operating system, most kernel components are moved "
"to user-space and adapted to work on it."
msgstr ""
"如同任何基於微內核的作業系統，大多數的內核組件都已移至使用者空間，並經過調整"
"以在其中運作。"

"Monolithic kernels in general have hundreds of system calls due to the high "
"number of kernel components (system calls are interfaces for these "
"components), not to mention the number of sub-syscalls provided by ioctl and "
"e.g. procfs/sysfs. Microkernels on the other hand, only have dozens of them."
msgstr ""
"一般而言，整體內核（Monolithic kernel）由於內核組件數量龐大，擁有數百個系統呼"
"叫（system calls，即這些組件的介面），更不用說透過 ioctl 以及例如 procfs/"
"sysfs 所提供的子系統呼叫數量。相較之下，微內核則僅有數十個系統呼叫。"

"This happens because the non-core kernel components are moved to user-space, "
"thereby relying on IPC instead, which we will later explain."
msgstr ""
"這是因為非核心的內核組件被移至使用者空間，進而改為依賴 IPC，我們稍後會對此進"

"User-space `bootstrap` is the first program launched by the kernel, and has "
"a simple design. The kernel loads the `initfs` blob, containing both the "
"bootstrap executable itself and the `initfs` image, that was passed from the "
"boot loader. It creates an address space containing it, and jumps to a "
"bootloader-provided offset. Bootstrap allocates a stack (in an Assembly "
"stub), `mprotect`s itself, and does the remaining steps to exec the `init` "
"daemon. It also sets up the `initfs` scheme daemon."

"The system calls used for IPC, are almost exclusively file-based. The kernel "
"therefore has to know what schemes to forward certain system calls to. All "
"file syscalls are marked with either `SYS_CLASS_PATH` or `SYS_CLASS_FILE`. "
"The kernel associates paths with schemes by checking their scheme prefix "
"against the scheme's name, in the former case, and in the latter case, the "
"kernel simply remembers which scheme opened file descriptors originated "
"from. Most IPC in general is done using schemes, with the exception of "
"regular pipes like Linux has, which uses `pipe2`, `read`, `write`, `close`. "
"Any scheme can also of course setup its own custom pipe-like IPC that also "
"uses the aforementioned syscalls, like `shm` and `chan` from `ipcd`."

"Schemes are implemented as a regular Rust trait in the kernel. Some builtin "
"kernel schemes exist, which just implement that trait. Userspace schemes are "
"provided via the `UserScheme` trait implementor, which relies on messages "
"being sent between the kernel and the scheme daemon. This channel is created "
"by scheme daemons when opening `:SCHEME_NAME`, which is parsed to the root "
"scheme `\"\"` with path `\"SCHEME_NAME\"`. Messages are sent by reading from "
"and writing to that root scheme file descriptor."

"So all file-based syscalls on files owned by user-space, will send a message "
"to that scheme daemon, and when the result is sent back, the kernel will "
"return that result back to the process doing the syscall."

"Communication between user-space and the kernel, is generally fast, even "
"though the current syscall handler implementation is somewhat unoptimized. "
"Systems with Meltdown mitigations would be an exception, although such "
"mitigations are not yet implemented."

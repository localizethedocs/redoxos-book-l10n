"Rust has enormous advantages, because for operating systems, security and "
"stability matters a lot."
msgstr ""

#: src/why-rust.md:7
msgid ""
"Since operating systems are such an integrated part of computing, they are "
"the most important piece of software."
msgstr ""

#: src/why-rust.md:9
msgid ""
"There have been numerous bugs and vulnerabilities in Linux, BSD, glibc, "
"Bash, X11, etc. throughout time, simply due to the lack of memory allocation "
"and type safety. Rust does this right, by enforcing memory safety statically."
msgstr ""

#: src/why-rust.md:11
msgid ""
"Design does matter, but so does implementation. Rust attempts to avoid these "
"unexpected memory unsafe conditions (which are a major source of security "
"critical bugs). Design is a very transparent source of issues. You know what "
"is going on, you know what was intended and what was not."
msgstr ""

#: src/why-rust.md:13
msgid ""
"The basic design of the kernel/user-space separation is fairly similar to "
"Unix-like systems, at this point. The idea is roughly the same: you separate "
"kernel and user-space, through strict enforcement by the kernel, which "
"manages system resources."
msgstr ""

#: src/why-rust.md:15
msgid ""
"However, we have an advantage: enforced memory and type safety. This is "
"Rust's strong side, a large number of \"unexpected bugs\" (for example, "
"undefined behavior) are eliminated at compile-time."
msgstr ""

#: src/why-rust.md:17
msgid ""
"The design of Linux and BSD is secure. The implementation is not. Many bugs "
"in Linux originate in unsafe conditions (which Rust effectively eliminates) "
"like buffer overflows, not the overall design."

"We hope that using Rust we will produce a more secure and stable operating "
"system in the end."

"`unsafe` is a way to tell Rust that \"I know what I'm doing!\", which is "
"often necessary when writing low-level code, providing safe abstractions. "
"You cannot write a kernel without `unsafe`."
msgstr ""

#: src/why-rust.md:25
msgid ""
"In that light, a kernel cannot be 100% verified by the Rust compiler, "
"however the unsafe parts have to be marked with an `unsafe`, which keeps the "
"unsafe parts segregated from the safe code. We seek to eliminate the "
"`unsafe`s where we can, and when we use `unsafe`s, we are extremely careful."

"As the kernel is small, it uses less memory to do its work. The limited "

msgstr ""

#: src/why-rust.md:57
msgid ""
"The C/C++ support for thread-safety is quite fragile. As such, it is very "
"easy to write a program that looks safe to run across multiple threads, but "
"which introduces subtle bugs or security holes. If one thread accesses a "
"piece of state at the same time that another thread is changing it, the "
"whole program can exhibit some truly confusing and bizarre bugs."

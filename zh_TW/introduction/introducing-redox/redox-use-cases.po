"Redox is a general-purpose operating system that can be used in many "
"situations. Some of the key use cases for Redox are as follows."

msgid ""
"Redox has the potential to be a secure server platform for cloud services "
"and web hosting. The improved safety and reliability that Redox can provide, "
"as it matures, makes it an excellent fit for the server world. Work remains "
"to be done on support for important server technologies such as databases "
"and web servers, as well as compatibility with high-end server hardware."

"Redox 有潛力成為雲端服務與網頁託管的安全伺服器平台。隨著 Redox 逐漸成熟，其所"
"能提供的安全性與可靠性提升，使其非常適合伺服器領域。目前仍需在支援重要伺服器"
"技術（例如：資料庫與網頁伺服器）以及高階伺服器硬體相容性方面持續努力。"

"Redox has plans underway for [virtualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"
"OS-level_virtualization) support. Although running an instance of Linux in a "
"container on Redox will lose some of the benefits of Redox, it can limit the "
"scope of vulnerabilities. Redox-on-Redox and Linux-on-Redox virtualization "
"have the potential to be much more secure than Linux-on-Linux. These "
"capabilities are still a ways off, but are among the goals of the Redox team."

"The development of Redox for the desktop is well underway. Although support "
"for accelerated graphics is limited at this time, Redox does include a "
"graphical user interface, and support on Rust-written GUI libraries like "
"[winit](https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit), [Iced](https://iced.rs/) "
"and [Slint](https://slint-ui.com/)."

"A demo version of Redox is available with several games and programs to try. "
"However, the most important objective for desktop is to host the development "
"of Redox. We are working through issues with some of our build tools, and "
"other developer tools such as editors have not been tested under daily use, "
"but we continue to make this a priority."

"Due to a fairly limited list of currently supported hardware, once self-"
"hosted development is available the development can be done inside of Redox "
"with more quick testing. We are adding more hardware compatibility as "
"quickly as we can, and we hope to be able to support the development on a "
"wide array of desktops and notebooks in the near future."

"Redox's modular architecture make it ideal for many telecom infrastructure "
"applications, such as routers, telecom components, edge servers, etc., "
"especially as more functionality is added to these devices. There are no "
"specific plans for remote management yet, but Redox's potential for security "
"and reliability make it ideal for this type of application."

"For embedded systems with complex user interfaces and broad feature sets, "
"Redox has the potential to be an ideal fit. As everyday appliances become "
"Internet-connected devices with sensors, microphones and cameras, they have "
"the potential for attacks that violate the privacy of consumers in the "
"sanctity of their homes. Redox can provide a full-featured, reliable "
"operating system while limiting the likelihood of attacks. At this time, "
"Redox does not yet have touchscreen support, video capture, or support for "
"sensors and buttons, but these are well-understood technologies and can be "
"added as it becomes a priority."

"Although there are no current plans to create a version of Redox for mission-"
"critical applications such as satellites or air safety systems, it's not "
"beyond the realm of possibility. As tools for correctness proofs of Rust "
"software improve, it may be possible to create a version of Redox that is "
"proven correct, within some practical limits."
msgstr ""
"雖然目前尚無計劃將 Redox 用於衛星或航空安全系統等關鍵任務應用，但這並非不可"
"能。隨著 Rust 軟體正確性證明工具的進步，未來或許能在某些實際限制內，開發出經"
"證明為正確的 Redox 版本。"
